# xsURL: Simplify and Share Your URLs
This web application simplifies and shortens long URLs into compact, shareable links. It ensures ease of use with effective error handling to improve the user experience.


Error Handling Scenarios:

1.Duplicate URL Submission
If a URL has already been shortened, the application will return the same shortened URL along with a message indicating it was previously shortened.

2.No URL Entered
If no URL is provided during submission, the application will respond with an error message prompting the user to enter a valid URL.

3.Invalid Shortened URL
If a user enters an incorrect or non-existent shortened URL, the application will notify the user that the URL is invalid.
